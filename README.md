# root-extraction

An implementation of **Adleman-Manders-Miller** Root Extraction Method.

Strengthened with **Hensel Lifting** and lookup table. ~~~only accelerated for "unrealistic" problems lol~~~

Solves $${x^r \equiv a \mod n}$$ with the factorization of odd n known. ~~~you know it's "even" hard~~~

r, factors and their exponents should be of proper size.

Forgive me for my shitty coding & documenting style.
